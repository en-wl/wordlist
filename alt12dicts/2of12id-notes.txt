I've gone through your list of differences and updated 2of12id.txt
appropriately, I hope.  Your list of differences exposed that some of them
were in fact wrong, representing changes that should not have been made to
2of12inf.  The next time I release 12dicts, I will correct these.  (Let me
know if you think it highly desirable that I release one immediately due to
these errors.)  Here is my commentary on all the entries which were not
straightforward:

escaloped, escaloping - These words should not have been removed.

meds - This word should not have been added, as "med" is not listed.  I
believe this is a thoughtless edit resulting from the presence of "med" in
the 2of4brif list.

metred, metring - These words should not have been removed.

narced, narcing - This is very difficult.  One of my source dictionaries
lists "narc" as a verb.  I think it's wrong - every other source I've seen
shows the verb as "nark".  To make it worse, the dictionary that lists the
verb "narc" neither lists inflections, nor shows an inflected usage.  Its
regular inflections ought to be "narcked" and "narcking", not "narced" and
"narcing".  However, the Google n-gram data I purchased shows no uses at all
of the -ck- forms, but a few of the -c- forms.  It is hard to know whether
to take the verb "narc" out of 2of12id, or to put the inflections back into
2of12inf.  In the realm of spelling checking, it is almost certainly best
for "narced" and "narcing" not be present in the dictionary.  I've rather
reluctantly marked the entry for "narc V:" with a "-", as being the result
that works out best for most users of the list.

weaselled, weaselling - These inflections are not shown, as far as I can
tell, in my dictionaries.  But I have other sources for these forms,
including a bigger dictionary by a publisher of one of my sources which
lists the word.  You could argue this either way, but since I'm sure that
these spellings exist, I'm going to be inclusive and remove the hyphens from
the "weasel V:" entry in 2of12id.

I'm attaching my edited 2of12id.txt.  Feel free to argue with me about any
of my conclusions.  And thanks for calling these errors to my attention
(even if you didn't realize that was what you were doing).

net (2) is also a noun, an abbreviated form of "net profit" or "net income".

Shorter OED makes this explicit.  "Gross income of these companies
improved last year, but their netts are still in decline."  (That's my
sentence, not the SOED's.)

American Heritage dictionary (CD ROM).

Common sense.  This seems to be a minority opinion, but I claim a
usage like "Our pancake house offers twenty-eight different syrups" is
not in any way unusual.  The Macmillan Dictionary for Advanced
Learners backs me up on this.

Let me put it this way. The sources from which 12dicts was compiled
indicate that it is uncountable. Now, I am compiler-savvy, and know
that in that area, optimization is certainly countable. One of my
sources gives an example where it talks about optimization of business
practices, and I don't know if the use of the term by non-computer
guys has become countable or not. It wouldn't surprise me either way.

I'll think about changing the 2of12inf file - I have already gone
against the dictionaries on that issue for a few words, so it wouldn't
be that big a deal. At any rate, whatever I decide, it seems
reasonable for you to mark it countable in any places where you
ordinarily accept the 12dicts rulings, which I presume would make your
user base happy. (I don't know when a new release of 12dicts will
occur, by the way, but I have started adding new neologisms to the
neologism file, which is mainly what a new release consists of these
days.)
