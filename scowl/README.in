Spell Checking Oriented Word Lists (SCOWL)
Revision 7.0 (SVN Revision 127)
December 27, 2010
by Kevin Atkinson (kevina@gnu.org)

The SCOWL is a collection of word lists split up in various sizes, and
other categories, intended to be suitable for use in spell checkers.
However, I am sure it will have numerous other uses as well.

The latest version can be found at http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/.

The directory final/ contains the actual word lists broken up into
various sizes and categories.  The r/ directory contains Readmes from
the various sources used to create this package.

The other directories contain the necessary information to recreate the
word lists from the raw data.  Unless you are interested in improving the
words lists you should not need to worry about what's here.  See the
section on recreating the words lists for more information on what's
there.

Except for the special word lists the files follow the following
naming convention:
  <spelling category>-<sub-category>.<size>
Where the spelling category is one of
  english, american, british, british_z, canadian, 
  variant_0, varaint_1, variant_2,
  british_variant_0, british_variant_1,
  canadian_variant_0, canadian_variant_1,
Sub-category is one of
  abbreviations, contractions, proper-names, upper, words
And size is one of
  10, 20, 35 (small), 40, 50 (medium), 55, 60, 70 (large), 
  80 (huge), 95 (insane)
The special word lists follow are in the following format:
  special-<description>.<size>
Where description is one of:
  roman-numerals, hacker

The perl script "mk-list" can be used to create a word list of the
desired size, it usage is:
  ./mk-list [-f] [-v#] <spelling categories> <size>
where <spelling categories> is one of the above spelling categories
(the english and special categories are automatically included as well
as all sub-categories) and <size> is the desired desired size.  The
"-v" option can be used to used to also include the appropriate
variants file up to level '#'.  The normal output will be a sorted
word list.  If you rather see what files will be included, use the
"-f" option.

When manually combining the words lists the "english" spelling
category should be used as well as one of "american", "british",
"british_z" (british with ize spelling), or "canadian".  Great care
has been taken so that that only one spelling for any particular word
is included in the main list (with some minor exceptions).  When two
variants were considered equal I randomly picked one for inclusion in
the main word list.  Unfortunately this means that my choice in how to
spell a word may not match your choice.  If this is the case you can
try including one of the "variant_0" spelling categories which
includes most variants which are considered almost equal.  The
"variant_0" spelling category corresponds mostly to American variants,
while the "british_variant_0" and "canadian_variant_0" are for British
and Canadian variants, respectively.  The "variant_1" spelling
categoies include variants which are also generally considered
acceptable, and "variant_2" contains variants which are seldom used
and may now even be considered correct.  There is no
"british_variant_2" or "canadian_variant_2" spelling category since
the distinction would be almost meaningless.

The "abbreviation" category includes abbreviations and acronyms which
are not also normal words. The "contractions" category should be self
explanatory. The "upper" category includes upper case words and proper
names which are common enough to appear in a typical dictionary. The
"proper-names" category included all the additional uppercase words.
Final the "words" category contains all the normal English words.

To give you an idea of what the words in the various sizes look like
here is a sample of 25 random words found only in that size:

@`src/rand-samples`

And here is a count on the number of in each spelling category
(american + english spelling category):

@`src/count`

(The "Words" column does not include the name count.)

Size 35 is the recommended small size, 50 the medium and 70 the large.
For spell checking I recommend using 60.  Sizes 70 and below contain
words found in most dictionaries while the 80 size contains all the
strange and unusual words people like to use in word games such as
Scrabble (TM).  While a lot of the the words in the 80 size are not
used very often, they are all generally considered valid words in the
English language.  The 95 contains just about every English word in
existence and then some.  Many of the words at the 95 level will
probably not be considered valid English words by most people.  I use
the 60 size for the English dictionary for Aspell, and I don't
recommend anyone use levels above 70 for spell checking.  Levels above
70 contain rarely used words which can hide misspellings of similar
more commonly used words.  For example the word "ort" can hide a
common typo of "or".  No one should need to use a size larger than 80,
the 95 size is labeled insane for a reason.

Accents are present on certain words such as café in iso8859-1 format.

CHANGES:

From Revision 6 to 7 (December 27, 2010)

  Updated to revision 5.0 of Varcon which corrected many errors,
  especially in the British and Canadian spelling categories.  Also
  added new spelling categories for the British and Canadian spelling
  variants and separated them out from the main variant_* categories.
  
  Moved Moby names lists (3897male.nam 4946fema.len 21986na.mes) to 95
  level since they contain too many errors and rare names.

  Moved frequently class 0 from Brian Kelk's Wordlist from 
  level 60 to 70, and also filter it with level 80 due to, too many
  misspellings.

  Many other minor fixes.

From Revision 5 to 6 (August 10, 2004)

  Updated to version 4.0 of the 12dicts package.

  Included the 3esl, 2of4brif, and 5desk list from the new 12dicts
  package.  The 3esl was included in the 40 size, the 2of4brif in the
  55 size and the 5desk in the 70 size.

  Removed the Ispell word list as it was a source of too many errors.
  This eliminated the 65 size.

  Removed clause 4 from the Ispell copyright with permission of Geoff
  Kuenning.

  Updated to version 4.1 of VarCon.

  Added the "british_z" spelling category which it British using the
  "ize" spelling.

From Revision 4a to 5 (January 3, 2002)

  Added variants that were not really spelling variants (such as
  forwards) back into the main list.

  Fixed a bug which caused variants of words to incorrectly appear in
  the non-variant lists.

  Moved rarly used inflections of a word into higher number lists.

  Added other inflections of a words based on the following criteria
    If the word is in the base form: only include that word.
    If the word is in a plural form: include the base word and the plural
    If the word is a verb form (other than plural):  include all verb forms
    If the word is an ad* form: include all ad* forms
    If the word is in a possessive form: also include the non-possessive

  Updated to the latest version of many of the source dictionaries.

  Removed the DEC Word List due to the questionable licence and
  because removing it will not seriously decrese the quality of SCOWL
  (there are a few less proper names).  

From Revision 4 to 4a (April 4, 2001)

  Reran the scripts on a never version of AGID (3a) which fixes a bug
  which caused some common words to be improperly marked as variants.

From Revision 3 to 4 (January 28, 2001)

  Split the variant "spelling category" up into 3 different levels.
  
  Added words in the Ispell word list at the 65 level.

  Other changes due to using more recent versions of various sources
  included a more accurete version of AGID thanks to the word of
  Alan Beale

From Revision 2 to 3 (August 18, 2000)

  Renamed special-unix-terms to special-hacker and added a large
  number of communly used words within the hacker (not cracker)
  community.

  Added a couple more signature words including "newbie".

  Minor changes due to changes in the inflection database.

From Revision 1 to 2 (August 5, 2000)

  Moved the male and female name lists from the mwords package and the
  DEC name lists form the 50 level to the 60 level and moved Alan's
  name list from the 60 level to the 50 level.  Also added the top
  1000 male, female, and last names from the 1990 Census report to the
  50 level.  This reduced the number of names in the 50 level from
  17,000 to 7,000.

  Added a large number of Uppercase words to the 50 level.

  Properly accented the possessive form of some words.

  Minor other changes due to changes in my raw data files which have
  not been released yet.  Email if you are interested in these files.

COPYRIGHT, SOURCES, and CREDITS:

@`cat Copyright`

The variant word lists were created from a list of variants found in
the 12dicts supplement package as well as a list of variants I created
myself.

The Readmes for the various packages used can be found in the
appropriate directory under the r/ directory.

FUTURE PLANS:

The process of "sort"s, "comm"s, and Perl scripts to combine the many
word lists and separate out the variant information is inexact and
error prone.  The whole things needs to be rewritten to deal with
words in terms of lemmas.  When the exact lemma is not known a best
guess should be made.  I'm not sure what form this should be in.  I
originally thought this should be some sort of database, but maybe I
should just slurp all that data into memory and process it in one
giant perl script.  With the amount of memory available these days (at
least 2 GB, often 4 GB or more) this should not really be a problem.

In addition, there is a very nice frequency analyze of the BNC corpus
done by Adam Kilgarriff.  Unlike Brain's word lists the BNC lists
include part of speech information.  I plan on somehow using these
lists as Adam Kilgarriff has given me the OK to use it in SCOWL.
These lists will greatly reduce the problem of inflected forms of a
word appearing at different levels due to the part-of-speech
information.

There is frequency information for some other corpus such as COCA
(Corpus of Contemporary American English) and ANS (Corpus of
Contemporary American English) which I might also be able to use.  The
formal will require permission, and the latter is of questionable
quality.

RECREATING THE WORD LISTS:

In order to recreate the word lists you need a modern version of Perl,
bash, the traditional set of shell utilities, a system that supports
symbolic links, and quite possibly GNU Make.  The easiest way to
recreate the word lists is to checkout SVN revision 127 (or tag
scowl-7.0) and simply type "make" (see http://wordlist.sourceforge.net).
You can try to download all the pieces manually, but you may not get
the same result since the latest version of some parts used to create
SCOWL may not have been released yet.

The src/ directory contains the numerous scripts used in the creation
of the final product. 

The r/ directory contains the raw data used to create the final
product.  If you checkout from SVN this directory should be populated
automatically for you.  If you insist on doing it the hard way see the
README file in the r/ directory for more information.

The l/ directory contains symbolic links used by the actual scripts.

Finally, the working/ directory is where all the intermittent files go
that are not specific to one source.
